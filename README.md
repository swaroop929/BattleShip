# Battleship Game in C++

## Introduction
Welcome to the C++ implementation of the classic Battleship game! This single-player version brings the timeless naval strategy game to life on your computer. It's a fun and engaging way to test your strategic thinking skills.

## Game Description
In this version of Battleship, players will set up their fleet of ships on a grid, then take turns firing shots to sink the opponent's ships. This project is designed as a single-player game against a computer-controlled opponent. It features a console-based user interface for ship arrangement and tracking shots, providing an intuitive and interactive gaming experience.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
This game is developed using robust OOP principles in C++, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase. Key OOP concepts utilized include:
- **Encapsulation**: Classes encapsulate the data and functions related to game elements, like ships and the game board.
- **Inheritance**: Utilizing inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes, allowing for reusable code and an organized structure.
- **Polymorphism**: Through polymorphic functions, the game can handle different game states and interactions dynamically.
- **Abstraction**: Abstracting complex operations behind simple interfaces, making the game easy to play and understand.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ files using your preferred compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the game.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to arrange your fleet and start playing against the computer.
